To create a variable that should store text,  
look at the following example: 
Example 
Create a variable called name of 
type String and assign it the value "John": 
String name = "John"; 
System.out.println(name); 
You can also declare a variable without assigning the value, and assign the value later: 
Example 
int myNum; 
myNum = 15; 
System.out.println(myNum); 
Note that if you assign a new value to an existing variable, it will overwrite the previous value: 
Example 
Change the value of myNum from 15 to 20: 
int myNum = 15; 
myNum = 20;  // myNum is now 20 
System.out.println(myNum); 
 
To create a variable that should store a number, 
look at the following  
Example 
Create a variable called myNum of 
type int and assign it the value 15 
int myNum = 15; 
System.out.println(myNum); 
Final Variables 
If you don't want others (or yourself) to overwrite existing values, use the final keyword (this will 
declare the variable as "final" or "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only): 
Example 
final int myNum = 15; 
myNum = 20;  // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final 
variable 
 
Other Types 
A demonstration of how to declare variables of other types: 
Example 
int myNum = 5; 
float myFloatNum = 5.99f; 
char myLetter = 'D'; 
boolean myBool = true; 
String myText = "Hello"; The "inner loop" will be executed one time for each iteration of the "outer loop": 
Example 
// Outer loop 
for (int i = 1; i <= 2; i++) { 
  System.out.println("Outer: " + i); // Executes 2 times 
   
// Inner loop 
  for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) { 
    System.out.println(" Inner: " + j); // Executes 6 times (2 * 3) 
  } 
} While Loop 
You can also use break and continue in while loops: 
Break Example 
int i = 0; 
while (i < 10) { 
  System.out.println(i); 
  i++; 
  if (i == 4) { 
    break; 
  } 
}  
Exercise: 
Stop the loop if i is 5. 
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { 
  if (i == 5) {    
    
; 
  } 
  System.out.println(i); 
} 
 
Continue Example 
int i = 0; 
while (i < 10) { 
  if (i == 4) { 
    i++; 
    continue; 
  } 
  System.out.println(i); 
  i++; 
} int y = 9; 
System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 10 is higher than 9 
Or even easier: 
Example 
System.out.println(10 > 9); // returns true, because 10 is higher than 9 In the examples below, we use the equal to (==) operator to evaluate an expression: 
Example 
int x = 10; 
System.out.println(x == 10); // returns true, because the value of x is equal to 10 
Example 
System.out.println(10 == 15); // returns false, because 10 is not equal to 15 
Real Life Example 
Let's think of a "real life example" where we need to find out if a person is old enough to vote. %= 3 
x = x % 3 
&= 
x &= 3 
x = x & 3 
|= 
x |= 3 
x = x | 3 
^= 
x ^= 3 
x = x ^ 3 
>>= 
x >>= 3 
x = x >> 3 
<<= 
x Java For Each Loop 
For-Each Loop 
There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array: 
Syntax 
for (type variableName : arrayName) { 
  // code block to be executed 
}
